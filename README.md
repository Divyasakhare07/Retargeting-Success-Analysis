# Retargeting-Success-Analysis

Background: A prominent travel agency has conducted an advertising campaign. Two datasets - ’Aban- doned.csv’ (ABD) and ’Reservation.csv’ (RES) - provide insights into customer interactions and outcomes from this campaign.
Objective: Determine the statistical success of a retargeting campaign by matching and analyzing the datasets.

Introduction
’Abandoned.csv’ contains data about customers who engaged but didn’t purchase a vacation package. Notice the potential missing data and duplicates. These customers were divided into test and control groups for a retargeting campaign. ’Reservation.csv’ documents customers who eventually purchased vacation packages.
Task: Establish whether the retargeting campaign was statistically effective.

1	Business Justification
1.	Explain why retargeting customers who initially didn’t buy a package makes business sense.  
Targeting customers who initially didn’t buy a package makes business sense for three main reasons:  
•	Increased brand awareness and recognition: By presenting advertisements to people who have previously engaged with their website, companies can ensure they remain in the forefront of these potential customers' minds. This enhances brand awareness and familiarity.  
•	Cost-effective advertising strategy: Retargeting gives businesses the chance to target people that already show interest in their products or services, which makes it more likely they'll be converted.  
•	Tailored and individualized advertisements: Retargeting enables businesses to craft ads that are specifically designed for and relevant to each person, thereby boosting the likelihood of them completing a purchase.
